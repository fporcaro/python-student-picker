# python-student-picker
A terminal-based application for "randomly" selecting a student.  Other features like pop-quiz mode and basket mode, which will choose students one at a time until all have been selected, then they all go back in.

Need to get client id and client secret from google apis following the documentation here: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python
and here: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

Essentially the credentials.json gets downloaded from the google api page where you can see the client id and client secret.
